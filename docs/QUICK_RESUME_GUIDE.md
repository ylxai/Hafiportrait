## 🔧 Quick Commands to Resume

### 1. Check Current Status
```bash
pm2 status
curl -f http://localhost:3002/api/health  # Should work
curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health  # Will fail (404)
```

### 2. Access Working Development
```bash
# Use this as temporary production
http://147.251.255.227:3002
```

### 3. Check Production Logs
```bash
pm2 logs hafiportrait-app --lines 20
# Will show continuous restart failures
```

## 🎯 Next Steps Options

### Option A: Quick Fix (Recommended)
**Use development as production temporarily**
```bash
# Development is stable and working
# Point users to port 3002 until production is fixed
```

### Option B: Fresh Production Setup
```bash
# Start clean production environment
mkdir /home/ubuntu/stable-new
cd /home/ubuntu/stable-new
cp -r /home/ubuntu/dev-workspace/* .
# Setup fresh production config
```

### Option C: Deep Investigation
```bash
# Investigate build issues
cd /home/ubuntu/stable
rm -rf .next node_modules
pnpm install
pnpm build --verbose
# Look for specific error patterns
```

## 📁 Key Files to Check

```bash
# PM2 Configs
/home/ubuntu/stable/ecosystem.config.js
/home/ubuntu/stable/ecosystem.development.config.js

# Environment Files  
/home/ubuntu/stable/.env.production
/home/ubuntu/dev-workspace/.env.local

# Build Output
/home/ubuntu/stable/.next/

```

## 🚨 Known Issues

1. **Production PM2 App**: Continuous restart loop (96+ restarts)
2. **Build Problems**: Missing vendor chunks, module not found errors
