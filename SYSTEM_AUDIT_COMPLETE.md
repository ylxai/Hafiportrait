        └── Event_{eventId}_{date}
            ├── photo1.jpg
            ├── photo2.jpg
            └── photo3.jpg
```

### **Real-time Performance**
```
⚡ Update Times:
├── Admin upload photo → Event page shows: 1-2 seconds
├── Admin delete photo → Event page removes: 1-2 seconds
├── Auto-refresh interval: 5 seconds (photos), 10 seconds (messages)
└── Cross-tab sync: Instant via broadcast events
```

### **Status Management**
```
🔄 Event Lifecycle:
Draft → Active → Paused/Completed → Archived
