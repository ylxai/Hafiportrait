    Dict contents can be essentially any object so long as they can be serialized by
    `cloudpickle`. This includes other Modal objects. If writing and reading in different
    environments (eg., writing locally and reading remotely), it's necessary to have the
    library defining the data type installed, with compatible versions, on both sides.
    Additionally, cloudpickle serialization is not guaranteed to be deterministic, so it is
    generally recommended to use primitive types for keys.

    **Lifetime of a Dict and its items**

    An individual Dict entry will expire after 7 days of inactivity (no reads or writes). The
    Dict entries are written to durable storage.

    Legacy Dicts (created before 2025-05-20) will still have entries expire 30 days after being
    last added. Additionally, contents are stored in memory on the Modal server and could be lost
    due to unexpected server restarts. Eventually, these Dicts will be fully sunset.

    **Usage**

    ```python
    from modal import Dict

    my_dict = Dict.from_name("my-persisted_dict", create_if_missing=True)

    my_dict["some key"] = "some value"
    my_dict[123] = 456

    assert my_dict["some key"] == "some value"
    assert my_dict[123] == 456
    ```

    The `Dict` class offers a few methods for operations that are usually accomplished
    in Python with operators, such as `Dict.put` and `Dict.contains`. The advantage of
    these methods is that they can be safely called in an asynchronous context by using
    the `.aio` suffix on the method, whereas their operator-based analogues will always
    run synchronously and block the event loop.

    For more examples, see the [guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/dicts-and-queues#modal-dicts).

    Additionally, cloudpickle serialization is not guaranteed to be deterministic, so it is
    generally recommended to use primitive types for keys.

    **Lifetime of a Dict and its items**

    An individual Dict entry will expire after 7 days of inactivity (no reads or writes). The
    Dict entries are written to durable storage.

    Legacy Dicts (created before 2025-05-20) will still have entries expire 30 days after being
    last added. Additionally, contents are stored in memory on the Modal server and could be lost
    due to unexpected server restarts. Eventually, these Dicts will be fully sunset.

    **Usage**

    ```python
    from modal import Dict

    my_dict = Dict.from_name("my-persisted_dict", create_if_missing=True)

    my_dict["some key"] = "some value"
    my_dict[123] = 456

    assert my_dict["some key"] == "some value"
    assert my_dict[123] == 456
    ```

    The `Dict` class offers a few methods for operations that are usually accomplished
    in Python with operators, such as `Dict.put` and `Dict.contains`. The advantage of
    these methods is that they can be safely called in an asynchronous context by using
    the `.aio` suffix on the method, whereas their operator-based analogues will always
    run synchronously and block the event loop.
