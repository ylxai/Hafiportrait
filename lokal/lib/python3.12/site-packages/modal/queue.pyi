    The queue can contain any object serializable by `cloudpickle`, including Modal objects.

    By default, the `Queue` object acts as a single FIFO queue which supports puts and gets (blocking and non-blocking).

    **Usage**

    ```python
    from modal import Queue

    # Create an ephemeral queue which is anonymous and garbage collected
    with Queue.ephemeral() as my_queue:
        # Putting values
        my_queue.put("some value")
        my_queue.put(123)

        # Getting values
        assert my_queue.get() == "some value"
        assert my_queue.get() == 123

        # Using partitions
        my_queue.put(0)
        my_queue.put(1, partition="foo")
        my_queue.put(2, partition="bar")

        # Default and "foo" partition are ignored by the get operation.
        assert my_queue.get(partition="bar") == 2

        # Set custom 10s expiration time on "foo" partition.
        my_queue.put(3, partition="foo", partition_ttl=10)

        # (beta feature) Iterate through items in place (read immutably)
        my_queue.put(1)
        assert [v for v in my_queue.iterate()] == [0, 1]

    # You can also create persistent queues that can be used across apps
    queue = Queue.from_name("my-persisted-queue", create_if_missing=True)
    queue.put(42)
    assert queue.get() == 42
    ```

    For more examples, see the [guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/dicts-and-queues#modal-queues).

    **Queue partitions (beta)**

    Specifying partition keys gives access to other independent FIFO partitions within the same `Queue` object.
    Across any two partitions, puts and gets are completely independent.
    For example, a put in one partition does not affect a get in any other partition.

    When no partition key is specified (by default), puts and gets will operate on a default partition.
    This default partition is also isolated from all other partitions.
    Please see the Usage section below for an example using partitions.

    **Lifetime of a queue and its partitions**

    By default, each partition is cleared 24 hours after the last `put` operation.
    A lower TTL can be specified by the `partition_ttl` argument in the `put` or `put_many` methods.
    Each partition's expiry is handled independently.

    As such, `Queue`s are best used for communication between active functions and not relied on for persistent storage.

    On app completion or after stopping an app any associated `Queue` objects are cleaned up.
    All its partitions will be cleared.

    **Limits**

    A single `Queue` can contain up to 100,000 partitions, each with up to 5,000 items. Each item can be up to 1 MiB.

    Partition keys must be non-empty and must not exceed 64 bytes.

class Queue(modal.object.Object):
    """Distributed, FIFO queue for data flow in Modal apps.

    The queue can contain any object serializable by `cloudpickle`, including Modal objects.

    By default, the `Queue` object acts as a single FIFO queue which supports puts and gets (blocking and non-blocking).

    **Usage**

    ```python
    from modal import Queue

    # Create an ephemeral queue which is anonymous and garbage collected
    with Queue.ephemeral() as my_queue:
        # Putting values
        my_queue.put("some value")
        my_queue.put(123)

        # Getting values
        assert my_queue.get() == "some value"
        assert my_queue.get() == 123

        # Using partitions
        my_queue.put(0)
        my_queue.put(1, partition="foo")
        my_queue.put(2, partition="bar")

        # Default and "foo" partition are ignored by the get operation.
        assert my_queue.get(partition="bar") == 2

        # Set custom 10s expiration time on "foo" partition.
        my_queue.put(3, partition="foo", partition_ttl=10)

        # (beta feature) Iterate through items in place (read immutably)
        my_queue.put(1)
        assert [v for v in my_queue.iterate()] == [0, 1]

    # You can also create persistent queues that can be used across apps
    queue = Queue.from_name("my-persisted-queue", create_if_missing=True)
    queue.put(42)
    assert queue.get() == 42
    ```

    For more examples, see the [guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/dicts-and-queues#modal-queues).

    **Queue partitions (beta)**

    Specifying partition keys gives access to other independent FIFO partitions within the same `Queue` object.
    Across any two partitions, puts and gets are completely independent.
    For example, a put in one partition does not affect a get in any other partition.

    When no partition key is specified (by default), puts and gets will operate on a default partition.
    This default partition is also isolated from all other partitions.
    Please see the Usage section below for an example using partitions.

    **Lifetime of a queue and its partitions**

    By default, each partition is cleared 24 hours after the last `put` operation.
    A lower TTL can be specified by the `partition_ttl` argument in the `put` or `put_many` methods.
    Each partition's expiry is handled independently.

    As such, `Queue`s are best used for communication between active functions and not relied on for persistent storage.

    On app completion or after stopping an app any associated `Queue` objects are cleaned up.
    All its partitions will be cleared.

    **Limits**

    A single `Queue` can contain up to 100,000 partitions, each with up to 5,000 items. Each item can be up to 1 MiB.

    Partition keys must be non-empty and must not exceed 64 bytes.
